## Conclusion

Web Programming is creating documents with HTML, styling/positioning the documents' content with CSS, and updating that content and servers based on events using JavaScript. We can break down the JavaScript part of web programming into three pillars that involve working with the DOM, JavaScript eventing and communication with the server. Now that we've seen how these pillars are connected in the abstract, we are ready to dive into seeing how they work together in detail.

>THINKING ABOUT LEARNING These "pillars" are not something professional developers outside Flatiron School curriculum recognize. You won't go into a tech interview and be asked: "Name the three pillars of web programming." These abstractions are a way to help learners (you!) recognize how what you're learning fits into three major activity areas. That said, if an interviewer asked you how to debug a web program and you said your strategy would be based on ensuring three "critical areas" were working, we think your interview answer would be off to a good start!

## Learning Goals

- Identify the three essential pillars of front-end web programming
- Cause a change to given code so that DOM updating effect is seen
- Cause a change to given code so that server-side behavior is stubbed in
- Cause a change to given code so that event listening has an effect

### Identify the Three Essential Pillars of Front-End Web Programming

We've introduced our three essential pillars of front-end web programming:

  - Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
  - Recognizing JS events
  - Communication with the server
