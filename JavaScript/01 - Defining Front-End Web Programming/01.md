# [Stitching Together the Three Pillars](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/front-end-web-programming/defining-front-end-web-programming/stitching-together-the-three-pillars)

>THINKING ABOUT LEARNING These "pillars" are not something professional developers outside Flatiron School curriculum recognize. You won't go into a tech interview and be asked: "Name the three pillars of web programming." These abstractions are a way to help learners (you!) recognize how what you're learning fits into three major activity areas. That said, if an interviewer asked you how to debug a web program and you said your strategy would be based on ensuring three "critical areas" were working, we think your interview answer would be off to a good start!

## Learning Goals

- Identify the three essential pillars of front-end web programming
- Cause a change to given code so that DOM updating effect is seen
- Cause a change to given code so that server-side behavior is stubbed in
- Cause a change to given code so that event listening has an effect
