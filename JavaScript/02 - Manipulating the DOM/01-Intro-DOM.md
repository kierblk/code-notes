# [Introducing the DOM and Just Enough JavaScript](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/front-end-web-programming/manipulating-the-dom/introducing-the-dom-and-just-enough-javascript)

## Introduction

JavaScript can do many kinds of work, from building web servers, to creating
"infinite scroll" effects, but it was originally designed to do a type of
programming called **Document-Object Model (DOM) programming**. Understanding
DOM programming is the foundation of front-end development.

DOM programming is using JavaScript to:

1.  Ask the DOM to find or `select` an HTML element or elements in the rendered
    page
2.  Remove and/or insert an element(s)
3.  Adjust a property of the selected element(s)

## Learning Goals

1.  Explain the JavaScript / DOM relationship

  JavaScript changes are made through a middle layer called the DOM.

  DOM = Document Object Model

  DOM only knows how to be spoken to in JavaScript.

2.  Explain "sight words"

  Vocabulary that the a person recognizes from memory without the need to decode for understanding.

3.  Explain "just enough JavaScript" concept

  The approach of learning JavaScript sight words as "just enough JavaScript". Meaning, you will learn just a few things to get started without really understanding the full concept.

5.  Explain that JavaScript has things
6.  Explain that JavaScript has `variables`
7.  Explain that JavaScript can compare things
8.  Explain that JavaScript has `collections`
9.  Explain that JavaScript is object-oriented
10.  Explain that JavaScript has `loops`
11. Explain that JavaScript `logs` with `console.log`
