# [JS Fundamentals: Looping and Iteration Code Along](https://learn.co/tracks/online-software-engineering-structured/front-end-web-programming/manipulating-the-dom/js-fundamentals-looping-and-iteration-code-along)

## Introduction

Sometimes, we need to do things repeatedly.

Let's say we have a bunch of gifts to wrap. They all happen to be the same size and shape, so for every gift, we need to cut a similarly sized piece of wrapping paper, fold it up over the edges of the gift, tape it together, and add a nice little card. Then we set the wrapped gift aside and moved onto the next gift.

In programming terms, we can think of our **collection** of gifts as an **Array** and the act of wrapping them as a function. For example:

```js
const gifts = ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"];

function wrapGift(gift) {
  # For Ruby or Pythonistas, note that the " is now a ` (back-tick)
  # We'll discuss interpolation in detail elsewhere, but note that
  # JavaScript uses ` like Ruby uses ".
  console.log(`Wrapped ${gift} and added a bow!`);
}
```

We could then call `wrapGift()` on each gift individually:

```js
wrapGift(gifts[0]);
wrapGift(gifts[1]);
wrapGift(gifts[2]);
```

However, this isn't very efficient or extensible. It's a lot of repetitive code
to write out, and if we had more gifts we'd have to write a whole new line for
each.

This is where loops come in handy! With a loop, we can just write the repeated
action **once** and perform the action on **every item in the collection**.

### 1. Explain the purpose of a loop

Loops are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. In
JavaScript, loops come in a few different flavors, but the main two are `for`
and `while` loops.

### 2. Understand when to use each type of loop

#### The `for` loop

Of the loops in JavaScript, the `for` loop is the most common. The `for` loop is
made up of four statements in the following structure:

```js
for ([initialization]; [condition]; [iteration]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

- Initialization
  - Typically used to initialize a **counter** variable.
- Condition
  - An expression evaluated before each pass through the loop. If this expression
    evaluates to `true`, the statements in the loop body are executed. If the
    expression evaluates to `false`, the loop exits.
- Iteration
  - A statement executed at the end of each iteration. Typically, this will involve
    incrementing or decrementing a counter, bringing the loop ever closer to
    completion.
- Loop body
  - Code that runs on each pass through the loop.

**_Usage_**: Use a `for` loop when you know exactly how many times you want the
loop to run (for example, when you have an array of known size).

#### The `while` loop

The `while` loop is similar to a `for` loop, repeating an action in a loop based
on a condition. Both will continue to loop until that condition evaluates to
`false`. Unlike `for`, `while` only requires condition and loop statements:

```js
while ([condition]) {
  [loop body]
}
```

#### When to Use `for` and `while`

JavaScript, like many programming languages, provides a variety of looping
options. Loops like `for` and `while` are actually just slight variations of the
same process. By providing a variety, we as programmers have a larger vocabulary
to work with.

Often, you will see `while` loops simply being used as an alternative to `for`
loops:

```js
let countup = 0;
while (countup < 10) {
  console.log(countup++);
}
```

This is perfectly fine as an alternative way to describe:

```js
for (let countup = 0; countup < 10; countup++) {
  console.log(countup);
}
```

If you're feeling a bit lost about when to use a `for` vs. a `while` loop, take
a deep breath. Most of the time, a regular `for` loop will suffice. It's by far
the most common looping construct in JavaScript. A general heuristic for
choosing which loop to use is to first try a `for` loop. If that doesn't serve
your purposes, then go ahead and try a `while` or [`do...while`][do...while]
loop. Also, remember that you can always refer to the
[documentation on these loops][loops and iteration] at any time.

Just don't forget - with `while`, make sure you are updating the condition on
each loop so that the loop eventually terminates!

### 3. Build a `for` loop

```js
for (let age = 30; age < 40; age++) {
  console.log(`I'm ${age} years old. Happy birthday to me!`);
}

// LOG: I'm 30 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 31 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 32 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 33 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 34 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 35 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 36 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 37 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 38 years old. Happy birthday to me!
// LOG: I'm 39 years old. Happy birthday to me!
```

In the above code, `let age = 30` is the **initialization**, as we create a
variable, `age`, that we'll use in the next three phases of the loop. Notice
that we use `let` instead of `const` because we need to increment the value of
`age`.

The **condition** for the above loop is `age < 40`, or, in other words, "Run the
code in the loop body until `age` is NOT less than `40`." As long as the
condition evaluates to `true`, execute the code in the loop body, increment the
value of `age`, and then reevaluate the condition. As soon as the condition
evaluates to `false`, exit the loop.

The **iteration** is `age++`, which increments the value of `age` by `1` after
every pass through the loop. We initialized `age` as `30`, and it retains that
value during the first pass through the loop. At the end of the first pass, we
increment `age` to `31`, check whether the condition still holds `true`, and,
since it does, run the loop body again with `age` as `31`. After that second
loop, we increment `age` to `32`, and so on.

The **loop body** is the set of statements that we want to run when the
condition evaluates to `true`.

The `for` loop is often used to iterate over every element in an array. Let's
rewrite our gift-wrapping action above as a `for` loop:

```js
const gifts = ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"];

function wrapGifts(gifts) {
  for (let i = 0; i < gifts.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Wrapped ${gifts[i]} and added a bow!`);
  }

  return gifts;
}

wrapGifts(gifts);
// LOG: Wrapped teddy bear and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped drone and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped doll and added a bow!
// => ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"]
```

We started our counter, `i`, at `0` because arrays have zero-based indexes. Our
condition states that we should run the code in the loop body while `i` is less
than `gifts.length` (`3` in the above example). Our iteration, `i++`, increments
our counter by `1` at the end of each pass through the loop.

In our loop body, notice that we reference `gifts[i]`. Since `i` starts out as
`0`, during the first pass through the loop `gifts[i]` is `gifts[0]` is `'teddy bear'`. During the second pass through the loop, `gifts[i]` is `gifts[1]` is
`'drone'`. And during the final pass through the loop, `gifts[i]` is `gifts[2]`,
which is `'doll'`. After the third pass through the loop, we increment `i` to
`3`, which is no longer less than `gifts.length`. Our condition evaluates to
`false`, and we exit the loop.

### 4. Build a `while` loop


The initialization and iteration statements of the `for` loop have not
disappeared, though. In fact, we could rewrite our original `for` loop gift
wrapping example using a `while` loop and achieve the exact same result:

```js
const gifts = ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"];

function wrapGifts(gifts) {
  let i = 0; // the initialization moved OUTSIDE the body of the loop!
  while (i < gifts.length) {
    console.log(`Wrapped ${gifts[i]} and added a bow!`);
    i++; // the iteration moves INSIDE the body of the loop!
  }

  return gifts;
}

wrapGifts(gifts);
// LOG: Wrapped teddy bear and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped drone and added a bow!
// LOG: Wrapped doll and added a bow!
// => ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"]
```

Notice that we've just moved the initialization and iteration statements -
declaring the `i` variable outside the loop, and now incrementing it _inside_
the loop.

> **CAUTION**: When using `while` loops, it is easy to forget to involve iteration.
> Leaving iteration out can result in a condition that _always_ evaluate to
> `true`, causing an infinite loop!

Because of their design, `while` loops are sometimes used when we _want_
a loop to run an indeterminate amount of times. If we were pseudocoding out a
program for planting a garden, we could use `while` to organize the work:

```js
function plantGarden() {
  let keepWorking = true;
  while (keepWorking) {
    chooseSeedLocation();
    plantSeed();
    waterSeed();
    keepWorking = checkForMoreSeeds();
  }
}
```

We can imagine that _while_ we have seeds, we take the same steps over and over.
Choose a location for a seed; plant it; water it. Then, check if there are more
seeds. If _not_, do not keep working.
