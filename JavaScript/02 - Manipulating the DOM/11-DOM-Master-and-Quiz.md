## Reflect

Remember our "Simple Liker" program. In it we saw that front end web programming is using three "pillars" working together:

[x] Manipulating the DOM
[ ] Recognizing JavaScript events
[ ] Communicate with the server

This whole unit has been about gaining the skills required to Manipulate the DOM. Since you can now update web pages using JavaScript, you can communicate things to users like "You've liked this message" by changing the appearance of the web page they're looking at.
