## Introduction

In JavaScript, functions are what's known as [first-class citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function) 
of the language.

This means they can be treated like any other variable, they can be: 

* assigned to a variable
* stored in a data structure
* passed as an argument to another function
* the return value of another function
