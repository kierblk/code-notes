## Introduction

When we create a `for` loop to loop over an array, we base the loop's condition
off of the `.length` of the array. This works, but it's a lot of syntactic cruft
to remember:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
  // Loop body
}
```

The problem is that we're using a _looping_ construct to perform _iteration_.

## 1. Explain the difference between looping and iteration.

There's a pretty fine line separating the concepts of _looping_ and _iteration_,
and only the truly pedantic will call you out if you use one in place of the
other.

Looping is the process of executing a set of statements **repeatedly until a
condition is met**. It's great for when we want to do something a specific
number of times (`for` loop) or unlimited times until the condition is met
(`while` loop).

Iteration is the process of executing a set of statements **once for each
element in a collection**.

## 2. Iterate over arrays with the `for...of` statement.

ES2015 introduced the `for...of` statement, and, well, just compare this to the
previous two snippets:

```js
const myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g'];

for (const element of myArray) {
  console.log(element);
}
```

It's so much cleaner than the looping solutions — no initialization of a
counter, no condition, no incrementing the counter, and no bracket notation to
access elements in the array (`myArray[i]`).

### `const` vs. `let`

As you might've noticed, `for...of` allows us to use `const` instead of `let`.
In `for` and `while` statements, `let` is required because we are incrementing a
counter variable. The incrementing process involves taking the counter's current
value, adding `1` to it, and then assigning that new value to the variable. That
reassignment precludes us from using our beloved `const`, which cannot be
reassigned.

Delightfully, the `for...of` statement involves no such reassignment. On each
trip into the loop body (which is a _block_ — note the curly braces), we assign
the next element in the collection to a **new** `element` variable. Upon
reaching the end of the block, the block-scoped variable vanishes, and we return
to the top. Then we repeat the process, assigning the next element in the
collection to a **new** `element` variable.

### Iterating over... strings?

A string is effectively an ordered collection (an array) of characters, which
`for...of` is more than happy to iterate over:

```js
for (const char of 'Hello, world!') {
  console.log(char);
}

// LOG: H
// LOG: e
// LOG: l
// LOG: l
// LOG: o
// LOG: ,
// LOG:
// LOG: w
// LOG: o
// LOG: r
// LOG: l
// LOG: d
// LOG: !
```

## 3. Enumerate an object's properties with the `for...in` statement.

The `for...in` statement has been around for a long time, and it's usually used
for iterating over the properties in an object. The statement follows this
syntax:

```js
for (const <KEY> in <OBJECT>) {
  // Code in the statement body
}
```

The `for...in` statement iterates over the properties in an object, but it
doesn't pass the entire property into the block. Instead, it only passes in the
_keys_:

```js
const address = {
  street1: '11 Broadway',
  street2: '2nd Floor',
  city: 'New York',
  state: 'NY',
  zipCode: 10004
};

for (const key in address) {
  console.log(key);
}

// LOG: street1
// LOG: street2
// LOG: city
// LOG: state
// LOG: zipCode
```

Accessing the object's values is as simple as combining the passed-in key with
the _bracket operator_:

```js
const address = {
  street1: '11 Broadway',
  street2: '2nd Floor',
  city: 'New York',
  state: 'NY',
  zipCode: 10004
};

for (const key in address) {
	console.log(address[key]);
}

// LOG: 11 Broadway
// LOG: 2nd Floor
// LOG: New York
// LOG: NY
// LOG: 10004
```

### `for...in` and order

As a general rule, **don't use `for...in` with arrays**. When iterating over an
array, an **ordered** collection, we would expect the elements in the array to
be dealt with **in order**. However, because of how `for...in` works under the
hood, there's no guarantee of order. From the [MDN documentation][for...in]:

> A `for...in` loop iterates over the properties of an object in an **arbitrary
> order** ... one cannot depend on the seeming orderliness of iteration, at least
> in a cross-browser setting).

Additionally, in the pre-ES2015 days, using `for...in` would often result in
different browsers iterating over the same object's properties in different
orders. That's not cool! Cross-browser consistency is very important.
