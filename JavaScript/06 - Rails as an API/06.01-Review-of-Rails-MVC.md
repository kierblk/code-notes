## Introduction

We left Rails with the ability to manage data and display it in a browser using
models, views and controllers. As we have seen, Rails can entirely handle the
front and backend of a website - one reason it is a great tool for web
development.

With Rails, though, we aren't required to strictly render ERB views.

## Review of MVC Structure

The model, view, controller structure is a separation of concerns where groups
of files have specific jobs and interact with each other in very defined ways:

- **Models:** The 'logic' of a web application. This is where data is
  manipulated and/or saved to a database.
- **Views:** The 'frontend', user-facing part of a web application - this is
  the only part of the app that the user interacts with directly. Views generally
  consist of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- **Controllers:** The go-between for models and views. The controller relays
  data from the browser to the application, and from the application to the
  browser.
