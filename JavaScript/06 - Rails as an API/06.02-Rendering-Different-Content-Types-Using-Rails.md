## Introduction

Rails can render multiple types of content.

## Overriding the Default Rails View

Leaving off from the solution of the last lesson, the `index` action rendered all
birds:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
  end
end
```

And we know that this is the same as explicitly stating:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render 'birds/index.html.erb'
  end
end
```

But we aren't restricted to displaying ERB. We can indicate what type
of content we want to render. Let's first look at plain text.

### Render Plain Text From a Controller

To render plain text from a Rails controller, you specify `plain:`, followed by
the text you want to display:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render plain: "Hello #{@birds[3].name}"
  end
end
```

In the browser, this displays as:

```text
Hello Mourning Dove
```

This isn't very fancy, but **_this is actually enough for us to start using our
JavaScript skills and access with a `fetch()` request_**. 

### Render JSON From a Controller

To render _JSON_ from a Rails controller, you specify `json:` followed by data
that can be converted to valid JSON:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: 'Remember that JSON is just object notation converted to string data, so strings also work here'
  end
end
```

We can pass strings as we see above, as well as hashes, arrays, and other data
types:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: { message: 'Hashes of data will get converted to JSON' }
  end
end
```

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: ['As','well','as','arrays']
  end
end
```

In our bird watching case, we actually already have a collection of data, `@birds`,
so we can write:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: @birds
  end
end
```
## Where is our Data Being Converted to JSON?

When we include an array or hash after `render json:`, it turns out that Rails
is actually being accomodating to us and implicitly handling the work of
converting that array or hash to JSON.

We can choose to explicitly convert our array or hash, without any problem by
adding `to_json` to the end:

```ruby
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: { birds: @birds, messages: ['Hello Birds', 'Goodbye Birds'] }.to_json
  end
end
```

This will produce the same result as it did before. The `to_json` method is
made available to both arrays and hashes in Rails,
but is not natively available to them in Ruby. It does exactly what it says - it
takes whatever array or hash it is called on and converts it to JSON.

Rails favors convention as well as a clean and clutter free controller, so it
has some built in 'magic' to handle things like this and keep us from having to
write `to_json` on the same line as `render json:` in every action we write.

## Say Goodbye to Instance Variables

So far in controller actions, we've typically seen instance variables being used,
just as we have in the examples in this lesson:

```rb
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @birds = Bird.all
    render json: @birds
  end
end
```

However, we really only needed instance variables when we were rendering to ERB.
Now that we are directly rendering to JSON in the same action, we no longer need
to deal with instance variables and can instead just use a local variable:

```rb
class BirdsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    birds = Bird.all
    render json: birds
  end
end
```
