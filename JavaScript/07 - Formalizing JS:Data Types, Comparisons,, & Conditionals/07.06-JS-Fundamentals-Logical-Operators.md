  ## Introduction

  Logical operators in Javascript are the powerful backbone on which most website
logic is based. Using JavaScript's three logical operators, NOT (`!`), AND (`&&`),
and OR (`||`), we'll learn how to negate and combine expressions.

## Describe How to Use `!` to Negate an Expression

### `!` NOT

The logical NOT operator (`!`), also called the _bang operator_, operates on an
expression, returning the opposite of the expression's truthiness. If `x`
resolves to a truthy value, `!x` returns `false`. If `x` is falsy, `!x` returns
`true`:

```js
const truthyValue = 'This value is truthy.';

!truthyValue;
// => false

const falsyValue = 0;

!falsyValue;
// => true
```

## Describe How to Convert an Expression to a Boolean Using `!!`

### `!!`

As a shorter way to convert any value into a boolean, we can use two NOT
operators:

```js
const truthyValue = 'This value is truthy.';

!truthyValue;
// => false

!!truthyValue;
// => true
```

## Define the `&&` and `||` Operators

### `&&` AND

The logical AND (`&&`) operator takes two expressions:

```js
expression1 && expression2;
```

The return value of the `&&` operator is always **one of the two expressions**.
If the first expression is falsy, `&&` returns the value of the first
expression. If the first expression is truthy, `&&` returns the value of the
second expression.

There are three different ways the `&&` operator can be evaluated:

| Left side | Right side     | Return value | Truthiness of return value |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Falsy     | Doesn't matter | Left side    | Falsy                      |
| Truthy    | Falsy          | Right side   | Falsy                      |
| Truthy    | Truthy         | Right side   | Truthy                     |

1.  If the left-side expression is falsy, the right-side expression doesn't matter
    at all. The `&&` operator returns the left side's falsy value and finishes.
2.  If the left-side expression is truthy, the `&&` operator returns the right side's
    value (whether it's truthy or falsy) and finishes.
    If you're feeling a little confused, that's ok. This is one of those concepts
    that's a a bit hard to understand unless you've played around with it in code,
    so make sure you're testing all of these new operators out in your browser's
    JavaScript console to get a feel for how they work.

### `||` OR

The logical OR (`||`) operator also takes two expressions:

```js
expression1 || expression2;
```

The return value of the `||` operator is always **one of the two expressions**.
If the first expression is truthy, `||` returns the value of the first
expression. If the first expression is falsy, `||` returns the value of the
second expression.

There are three different ways the `||` operator can be evaluated:

| Left side | Right side     | Return value | Truthiness of return value |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Truthy    | Doesn't matter | Left side    | Truthy                     |
| Falsy     | Truthy         | Right side   | Truthy                     |
| Falsy     | Falsy          | Right side   | Falsy                      |

1.  If the left-side expression is truthy, the right-side expression doesn't matter
    at all. The `||` operator returns the left side's truthy value and completes.
2.  If the left-side expression is falsy, the `||` operator returns the right side's
    value (regardless of whether it's truthy or falsy) and completes.
    As with the `&&` operator, make sure you're testing out all of these outcomes in your
    browser's JS console!

## Describe How to Link Conditions Using the `&&` and `||` Operators

The `&&` and `||` operators are often used to link multiple conditions in a
conditional statement:

```js
let user = 'Charles Babbage';
let friendCount = 3;
let message, messageColor;

if (user && friendCount) {
  message = `Hi ${user}! You have ${friendCount} ${
    friendCount === 1 ? 'friend' : 'friends'
  }!`;
} else if (user) {
  message = 'Link up with your friends to get the most out of Flatbook!';
} else {
  message = 'Please sign in.';
}
// => "Hi Charles Babbage! You have 3 friends!"

if (
  message === 'Please sign in.' ||
  message === 'Link up with your friends to get the most out of Flatbook!'
) {
  messageColor = 'red';
} else if (friendCount >= 1 && friendCount <= 10) {
  messageColor = 'blue';
} else if (friendCount >= 11 && friendCount <= 50) {
  messageColor = 'purple';
} else {
  messageColor = 'rainbow';
}
// => "blue"
```
