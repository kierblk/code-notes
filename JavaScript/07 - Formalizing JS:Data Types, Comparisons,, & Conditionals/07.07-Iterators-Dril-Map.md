## Introduction

As developers, we find ourselves responsible for all sorts of common, but
tedious, tasks, such as iterating over arrays. Although a `for` loop or nesting
in lists and collections will complete the task, we can take advantage of a
method like `map()` to organize and optimize our code into building blocks
of functions, which we can then chain together to create more readable and
understandable functions.

## Define How the `map()` Method Works

`Array.prototype.map()` is an array method that iterates over all elements,
allowing you to apply a function to each element in that array, and changing
them into something else. 

The result is then returned as a *new* array, leaving
the original array unmodified. This is super important, because it saves us from having to create a new array ourselves and copy stuff in there, **or** modifying the original elements in the array, which we may need later.

## Demonstrate `map()` With `Array`s

We use `map()` when we want to perform an action on each element in the collection,
and "gather" the results into a new `Array`.

### `for` and `for...of`

In this example, we are using a standard bit of iteration code. Because
`for ` and `for...of` are _general_ functions that can be used to do lots
of things another programmer won't be sure if the inner workings return
values are important or not.

```js
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = [];

for (const student of students) {
  rollCall.push( student + " the wizard" );
}

//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

### `map()` With a Function Declaration

When we write `.map()` we are saying to other programmers: "Expect a new array
to come out of this after each element is touched!"

```js
function studentRollCall(student) {
  return student + " the wizard";
}

let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map(studentRollCall);
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

With `map()`, we have a list of _n_ things and want that list of _n_ things
to be transformed.

The iterator function `map()` expects to be _passed a function as an
argument_ which they will hand each of their elements off to. In the case of
`map()` it hands each element to the function and stores the return value of
the function into a new `Array`.

This code is more _expressive_ because it lives up to the promise of map. It
creates a new `Array` after each element is "touched" by a function.

One drawback to this code is that the `studentRollCall` function doesn't do
much work. It just returns something that the `student` _already_ knew how to
do.  What if we use a function expression ("anonymous function") instead?

### `map()` With a Function Expression

```js
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map(function(student) {
  return student + " the wizard";
});
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

That's much shorter. It has all the same advantages of the previous version.

### `map()` With an Arrow Function

Thanks to arrow functions, we can shorten up the function expression to:

```js
// When the parameter list is only one element, we can drop () !
let students = ["harry", "ron", "hermione", "ginevra"];
let rollCall = students.map(student => student + " the wizard")
//=> rollCall = ["harry the wizard", "ron the wizard", "hermione the wizard", "ginevra the wizard"];
```

The code now fits on one line! There is much less noisy JavaScript code so
the _expressiveness_ has increased: "`rollCall` is the result of `map`-ing
`students`.

## Demonstrate `map()` With Complex Data Structures

Let's use the `map()` function on a trickier data structure â€” a list of robots.

To start things off, we have an array of robots. Each robot is an _object_.

Now, let's activate all of them. An activated robot needs to be marked as such using the `isActivated` boolean, as well as have its number of modes doubled:

```js
const robots = [
  { name: 'Johnny 5', modes: 5, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'C3PO', modes: 3, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'Sonny', modes: 2.5, isActivated: false, },
  { name: 'Baymax', modes: 1.5, isActivated: false, },
];

const activatedRobots = robots.map(function (robot) {
  return Object.assign({}, robot, {
    modes: robot.modes * 2,
    isActivated: true,
  });
});

console.log(activatedRobots);

/*
 Result:
 [
   { name: 'Johnny 5', modes: 10, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'C3PO', modes: 6, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'Sonny', modes: 5, isActivated: true },
   { name: 'Baymax', modes: 3, isActivated: true }
 ]
*/
```
**REMINDER** [`Object.assign()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)

>The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object.

With  the native `map()` function that is a property of `Array`'s prototype,
it gives us the exact same result! Now that we know how map is implemented,
it holds no more secrets for us! We can discard our own `map()` function and
just use the `map()` property on arrays.

## Use `map()` to Generate a New Array

Let's put our newly acquired knowledge of `map()` to use! We just uploaded 10 coding
tutorials online, but some of them have inconsistent casing. We want all the titles
to be "title case", in other words, the _first_ letter of each word is capitalized.
Create a new array with the new names of each tutorial that is in the proper title
case formatting.

For example, `what does the this keyword mean?` should become `What Does The This Keyword Mean?`.

```js
const tutorials = [
  'what does the this keyword mean?',
  'What is the Contutorialuctor OO pattern?',
  'implementing Blockchain Web API',
  'The Test Driven Development Workflow',
  'What is NaN and how Can we Check for it',
  'What is the difference between stopPropagation and preventDefault?',
  'Immutable State and Pure Functions',
  'what is the difference between == and ===?',
  'what is the difference between event capturing and bubbling?',
  'what is JSONP?'
];

const titleCased = () => {
  // map each sentence in the tutorials array
  return tutorials.map( sentence => {
    // split each sentence into an array of words
    let words = sentence.split(' ')
    // map each word in the words array
    // select the first letter of the word via .charAt(0)
    // capitalize the lett via .toUpperCase()
    // add the rest of the characters from word via .slice(1)
    let capitalizedWords =
      words.map( word => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1) )
    // rejoin all the words to recereate the sentence
    let response = capitalizedWords.join(' ')
    // returns response to the map function
    return response
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

`map()` takes 2 arguments--a callback and the optional context. The callback runs
for each value in an array and returns each new value in the resulting array. It
returns a new array that is the same length as the original array and saves time
while making the code simpler and easy to read.
