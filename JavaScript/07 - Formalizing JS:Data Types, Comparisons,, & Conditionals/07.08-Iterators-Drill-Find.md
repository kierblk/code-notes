- [MDN: Array.prototype.find()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)

## Introduction

In any programming language, you'll perform operations on arrays. Looking in
an `Array` for a sub string or set of characters is a common task. Sometimes
you need to look for a _specific_ item in the array, and return it. Given a
string or array you can iterate over its elements and perform actions. ES6
introduced a few new `Array` methods--one of them being `find()`.

## Demonstrate `find()`

The `find` function behaves similar to others in JavaScript (like `filter`)
that want a truthy/falsey result. `find` returns the **first**
element for which the function returns true, a single element.

```js
[1,3,5,6,8].find(function(e) { return e % 2 === 0 })
```

**Note**: You could have multiple matches, but `find` returns _only the first
element_. This could lead to some bugs if you're not careful.

```js
let roommates = ["jess", "winston", "winston", "nick"];

roommates.find( function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> winston

roommates.filter(function(s) { return s === "winston" })
//=> [winston, winston]
```

## Use `find()` to Isolate a Specific Result
