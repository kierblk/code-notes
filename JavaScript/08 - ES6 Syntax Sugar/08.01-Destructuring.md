## Introduction

As developers, sometimes we receive information in a collection like an
`Object` and we want to "pick and choose" elements out of the collection. It's
a major pain to extract each property / value pair out of an `Object` and then
assign it to a variable.

Destructuring lets us type less and be more clear about what we want to pull
out of an `Object`.  Not only does destructuring help when working with data in
your application, it's essential for understanding how to get JavaScript to
include third-party code (like you find on [npm][]).

## Use Destructuring to Assign Data to Variables

In JavaScript, when we want to assign data to single variables from a top level
object such as this, we normally do it individually like so:

```js
const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_food: 'hot_dogs'
};
const first = doggie.first;  // Buzz
const breed = doggie.breed; // Great Pyrenees
```

This is repetitive code. The algorithm at play is:

1. Declare a variable with a name (e.g. `first` or `breed`)
2. Use that variable's name to point to an attribute in the `Object` whose name
   matches the name of the variable (e.g. `doggie.breed` or `doggie.first`)
3. Assign the attribute's value to the created variable


JavaScript gives us the ability to perform this algorithm with _one_ simple
line of code.

```js

const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_food: 'hot_dogs'
};

const { first, breed } = doggie;
console.log(first); 
console.log(breed); 

```

We can also use it to destructure a nested syntax:
```js

const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_foods: {
    meats:{
      ham: 'smoked',
      hot_dog: 'oscar_meyer',
    },
    cheeses:{
      american: 'kraft'
    }
  }
};

const { ham, hot_dog } = doggie.favorite_foods.meats;
console.log(ham); 
console.log(hot_dog); 

```

### Destructuring Assignment with Arrays

Destructuring does not just work on objects - we can also use the same syntax
with `Array`s as well. 

```js

const dogs = ['Great Pyrenees', 'Pug', 'Bull Mastiff']
const [medium, small, giant] = dogs
console.log(medium, small, giant) // Great Pyrenees, Pug, Bull Mastiff
```

The cool part is we can pick the parts of the `Array` that we want to assign!
```js

const dogs = ['Great Pyrenees', 'Pug', 'Bull Mastiff']
const [, small, giant] = dogs
console.log(small, giant) //  Pug, Bull Mastiff
```

### Destructuring Assignment with Strings

We can also destructure with strings, as a whole:

```js
const dogsName = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'
const [title, firstName, lastName] = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'.split(' ')
console.log(title, firstName, lastName) // Sir Woody BarksALot
```

And we can also destructure it in parts, just as we did with `Array`s above: 

```js
const dogsName = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'
const [title, ,lastName] = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'.split(' ')
console.log(title, lastName) // Sir BarksALot
```
