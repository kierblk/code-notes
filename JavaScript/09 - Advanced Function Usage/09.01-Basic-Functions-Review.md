## Define a Function Using Function Declaration

In JavaScript, the most common way to define functions is with a **function
declaration**:

```js
function razzle() {
  console.log("You've been razzled!");
}
```

The word `razzle` becomes a _pointer_ to some stored, potential,
not-yet-actually-run bit of work (the function). We use the _pointer_ to _call_
or _invoke_ the function. We _call_ the function by adding `()` after the _pointer_.

```js
function razzle() {
  console.log("You've been razzled!");
}
razzle()
//=> "You've been razzled!"
```

Functions can be passed arguments, given default arguments, etc.  Here's a
brief code synopsis:

```js
function razzle(lawyer="Billy", target="'em") {
  console.log(`${lawyer} razzle-dazzles ${target}!`);
}
razzle() //=> Billy razzle-dazzles 'em!
razzle("Methuselah", "T'challah") //=> Methuselah razzle-dazzles T'challah!
```

## Define the Term Hoisting

JavaScript's ability to call functions _before_ they appear in the code is
called _hoisting_. For hoisting to work, **the function must be defined as a
function declaration**.

## Define a Function Using a Function Expression

Early in your programming career, you probably learned that programming
languages feature _expressions_: arrangements of constants, variables, and
symbols that, when interpreted by the language, produce a _value_.

```js
1 + 1 //=> 2
"Razzle " + "dazzle!" //=> "Razzle dazzle!"
```

By analogy, if we agree that JavaScript has function _expressions_ that look
like this:

```js
function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling")
}
```

what is in the variable `fn` at the end of this block of code?

```js
let fn = function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling")
}
```

This **function expression** evaluates to "stored work." Instead of the value `2`
when `1 + 1` is evaluated, in `fn` JavaScript stores _work_ &mdash; something that's
much harder to visualize than `2`! If we ask JavaScript what's in `fn`, it says:

```js
let fn = function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling")
} //=> undefined
fn //=> ƒ () { console.log("Yet more razzling") }
```

Here, Chrome tells us that `fn` points to an un-executed function, a "frozen"
function, a "potential" function, a "recipe" for work.

Here, `fn` is a _pointer_ to the stored block of work. But the work is merely
_potential_, it hasn't been _done_ yet. Just as with **function declaration**,
we need to _invoke_ or _call_ the function.

To **do** the work, to make the potential real, to "un-freeze" the function, we
add `()` to the end, optionally adding arguments.

```js
let fn = function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling")
} //=> undefined
fn //=> ƒ () { console.log("Yet more razzling") }
fn() //=> "Yet more razzling"
```

In any case, a **function expression** comes about when we write
`function(){...}` and assign it to a variable. Very importantly, ***function
expressions are not hoisted***. 

## Define the Term "Anonymous Function"

We also call the expression that produces a function that uses the template
`function(){....}` an "***anonymous function***." In the previous example the
following was the anonymous function:

```js
function() {
  console.log("Yet more razzling")
}
```

Unlike a ***function declaration***, there's no function name in front of the
`()`. Since anonymous means, "without a name," this function is called,
sensibly enough, an anonymous function.

## Define an IIFE: Instantly-Invoked Function Expression

TODO: Find a better explanation of IIFE

As a thought experiment, what happens here:

```js
(function(baseNumber){ return baseNumber + 3 })(2) //=> ???
```

We recognize the first `()` as being those that we might use from arithmetic to
make something happen first in terms of order-of-operations. In the example
below, although we would normally expect `*` to happen before `-`, instead it 
happens after since the `()` evaluation is performed earlier:

```js
( 3 - 4 ) * 2 // => -2
```

So in the IIFE statement, the first parentheses return an anonymous function.
It's like we assigned an anonymous function to a variable name, but didn't do
the actual assignment and are instead left the right hand side of the
assignment: a thing that can be invoked (instantly).

The second `()` are the `()` of function invocation like `sayHello()` having
`()` after the `o`. It means, do the work in the function identified by the
name `sayHello`.

Put these two components together and  we're "invoking" the function
immediately after defining it. Thus the name Instantly-Invoked Function 
Expression (IIFE for short).

```js
(function(baseNumber){ return baseNumber + 3 })(2) //=> 5
```

Interestingly, any variables, functions, `Array`s, etc. that are defined
_inside_ of the function expression's body _can't_ be seen _outside_ of the
IIFE.

## Define the Term "Function-level Scope"

JavaScript exhibits "Function-level" scope. This means that if a function is
defined _inside another_ function, the inner function has access to all the
parameters (variables passed in) of, as well as any variables defined in, the outer 
function. This moves backward recursively too. Each of the enclosing parents' 
scopes are made available via the _scope chain_.

## Define the Term "Closure"

In the previous example, we could call the "inner" function, the **anonymous
function** a "closure." It "encloses" the function-level scope of its parent.
And, like a backpack, it can carry out the knowledge that it saw - _even when
you're out of the parent's scope_.

Recall the IIFE discussion, since what's inside an IIFE can't be seen, if we
wanted to let just tiny bits of information leak back out, we might want to
pass that information back out, through a closure.

_Note: We're also using destructuring assignment, don't forget your ES6 tools!_

```js
let [answer, theBase] = (
  function(thingToAdd) {
    let base = 3
    return [
      function() { return base + thingToAdd },
      function() { return base }
    ]
  }
)(2)
answer() //=> 5
console.log(`The base was ${theBase()}`)
// OUTPUT: The base was 3
```

## Define the Term "Scope Chain"

The mechanism behind all the cool stuff we just saw is the _scope chain_ which
allows functions defined in functions to access all their parent scopes'
variables.  Here's a simple example:

```js
function demoChain(name) {
  let part1 = 'hi'
  return function() {
    let part2 = 'there'
    return function() { // Innermost
      console.log(`${part1.toUpperCase()} ${part2} ${name}`);
    }
  }
}

demoChain("Dr. Stephen Strange")()() //=> HI there Dr. Stephen Strange
```

Through the _scope chain_, the function labeled `//Innermost` has access to
`name`, `part1`, and `part2` when it is called and runs the `console.log()`
statement. That's awesome wormhole, space-time, magic!
