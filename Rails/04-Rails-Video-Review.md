# [Rails Video Review: Intro to Rails](https://github.com/saramccombs/rails-video-review-intro-to-rails)

## Summary

This video covers the flow of logic and the process it takes to get from the view to the browser. 

First, we need a model. Then, we need a controller with a corresponding action, a route to match the controller action, and the view that will be rendered in the browser when that controller action is hit.

Rails has the following components: 

- `ActiveRecordModels` - comprises methods for helping build your Rails application 

- `ActionController` - for controlling the flow of data between the model and the view Actionview - rendering the view without having to write explicit html
