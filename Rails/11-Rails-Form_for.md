# [Rails `form_for`](https://github.com/saramccombs/rails-form_for-on-edit-readme-online-web-pt-081219)

## Recap of `form_tag`

To review, the `form_tag` helper method allows us to automatically generate HTML form code and integrate data to both auto fill the values as well as have the form submit data that the controller can use to either create or update a record in the database. It allows for you to pass in: the route for where the parameters for the form will be sent, the HTTP method that the form will utilize, and the attributes for each field.

## Issues with using `form_tag`

Before we get into the benefits and features of the `form_for` method, let's first discuss some of the key drawbacks to utilizing `form_tag`:

* Our form must be manually passed to the route where the form parameters will be submitted

* The form has no knowledge of the form's goal; it doesn't know if the form is meant to create or update a record

* You're forced to have duplicate code throughout the form; it's hard to adhere to DRY principles when utilizing the `form_tag`

## Difference between `form_for` and `form_tag`

The differences between `form_for` and `form_tag` are subtle, but important. Below is a basic breakdown of the differences. We'll start with talking about them at a high level perspective and then get into each one of the aspects on a practical/implementation basis:

* The `form_for` method accepts the instance of the model as an argument. Using this argument, `form_for` is able to make a bunch of assumptions for you.

* `form_for` yields an object of class `FormBuilder`

* `form_for` automatically knows the standard route (it follows RESTful conventions) for the form data as opposed to having to manually declare it

* `form_for` gives the option to dynamically change the `submit` button text (this comes in very handy when you're using a form partial and the `new` and `edit` pages will share the same form, but more on that in a later lesson)

A good rule of thumb for when to use one approach over the other is below:

* Use `form_for` when your form is directly connected to a model. Extending our example from the introduction, this would be our Hamster's profile edit form that connects to the profile database table. This is the most common case when `form_for` is used

* Use `form_tag` when you simply need an HTML form generated. Examples of this would be: a search form field or a contact form

## Implementation of `form_for`

Let's take the `edit` form that utilized the `form_tag` that we built before for `posts` and refactor it to use `form_for`. As a refresher, here is the `form_tag` version:

```erb
<% # app/views/posts/edit.html.erb %>
<h3>Post Form</h3>

<%= form_tag post_path(@post), method: "put" do %>
  <label>Post title:</label><br>
  <%= text_field_tag :title, @post.title %><br>

  <label>Post description</label><br>
  <%= text_area_tag :description, @post.description %><br>

  <%= submit_tag "Submit Post" %>
<% end %>
```

Let's take this refactor one element at a time. Since we already have access to the `@post` instance variable we know that we can pass that to the `form_for` method. We also can remove the path argument and the `method` call since `form_for` will automatically set these for us. How does `form_for` know that we want to use `PUT` for the form method? It's smart enough to know that since it's dealing with a pre-existing record you want to utilize `PUT` over `POST`.

```erb
<%= form_for(@post) do |f| %>
```

The `|f|` is an iterator variable that we can use on the new form object that will allow us to dynamically assign form field elements to each of the `@post's` data attributes, along with auto filling the values for each field. We get this `ActionView` functionality because we're using the `form_for` method, which gives us access to the [`FormBuilder` module in Rails](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormBuilder.html). Inside of the form, we can now refactor the fields:

```erb
<label>Post title:</label><br>
<%= f.text_field :title %><br>

<label>Post description</label><br>
<%= f.text_area :description %><br>
```

Isn't that much cleaner? Notice how we no longer have to pass in the values manually? By passing in the attribute as a symbol (e.g. `:title`) that will automatically tell the form field what model attribute to be associated with. It also is what auto-fills the values for us. Next, let's refactor the submit button. Instead of `<%= submit_tag "Submit Post" %>`, we can change it to:

```erb
<%= f.submit %>
```

Our new form will look something like this:

```erb
<h3>Post Form</h3>

<%= form_for(@post) do |f| %>
  <label>Post title:</label><br>
  <%= f.text_field :title %><br>

  <label>Post description</label><br>
  <%= f.text_area :description %><br>

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Our refactor work isn't quite done. If you had previously created a `PUT` route like we did in the `form_tag` lesson, we'll need to change that to a `PATCH` method since that is the HTTP verb that `form_for` utilizes. We can make that change in the `config/routes.rb` file:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :posts, only: [:index, :show, :new, :create, :edit, :update]
```

```ruby
patch 'posts/:id', to: 'posts#update'
```

What's the difference between `PUT` and `PATCH`? It's pretty subtle. On a high level, `PUT` has the ability to update the entire object, whereas `PATCH` simply updates the elements that were changed. Many developers choose to utilize `PATCH` as much as possible because it requires less overhead; however, it is pretty rare when you will need to distinguish between the two verbs, and they are used interchangeably quite often.

You can also add `update` as an additional argument in the `resources` method array, and this will all happen automatically.

Now if you start the Rails server and go to an `edit` page, you'll see that the data is loaded into the form and everything appears to be working properly. However, if you change the value of one of the form fields and click `Update Post`, you will see that the record updates incorrectly. So what's happening? When you run into behavior like this, it's good practice to look at the console logs to see if they tell us anything. Below is an example of what you might see after submitting the form:

![Unpermitted Parameters](https://s3.amazonaws.com/flatiron-bucket/readme-lessons/unpermitted_params.png)

Because `form_for` is bound directly with the `Post` model, we need to pass the model name into the Active Record `update` method in the controller. Let's change `@post.update(title: params[:title], description: params[:description])` to:

```ruby
@post.update(params.require(:post).permit(:title, :description))
```

So, why do we need to `require` the `post` model? If you look at the old form, the `params` would look something like this:

```
{
  "title": "My Title",
  "description": "My description"
}
```

With the new structure introduced by `form_for`, the `params` now look like this:

```
{
  "post": {
            "title": "My Title",
            "description": "My description"
          }
}
```

Notice how the `title` and `description` attributes are now nested within the `post` hash? That's why we needed to add the `require` method. But Rails wants us to be conscious of which attributes we allow to be updated in our database, so we must also `permit` the `title` and `description` in the nested hash. Using strong parameters like this will allow ActiveRecord to use mass assignment without trouble.
