# [Rails - Delete Forms](https://github.com/saramccombs/delete-forms-rails)

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

delete '/people/:id', to: 'people#destroy', as:'person'
```

```erb
# app/views/people/show.html.erb

<h2><%= @person.name %></h2>
<%= @person.email %>
<%= form_tag person_path(@person.id), method: "delete" do %>
  <%= submit_tag "Delete #{@person.name}" %>
<% end %>
```

But, wait a minute... there's something weird about the output we get:

```html
<h2>Caligula</h2>
caligula@rome-circa-40-AD.com
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="/people/1" method="post">
  <input name="_method" type="hidden" value="delete" />
  <input name="utf8" type="hidden" value="&#x2713;" />
  <input name="authenticity_token" type="hidden" value="f755bb0ed134b76c432144748a6d4b7a7ddf2b71" />
  <input name="commit" type="submit" value="Delete Caligula" />
</form>
```

What you're seeing in the above `#form_tag()` behavior is a **workaround**
implemented for us by Rails itself. With this in mind, we get the best of both
worlds:

- We get to be **good HTTP-abiding citizens** who use the correct request methods
  for their corresponding goals (`GET` for read, `PATCH` for update, and so on).
- We get to **maintain our sanity** and not worry about W3C drama while writing
  views.

  Thus enlightened, we can (finally) proceed with our original goal:

```ruby
# app/controllers/people_controller.rb

  def destroy
    Person.find(params[:id]).destroy
    redirect_to people_url
  end
```

Nothing too special happening here except for a bit of method-chaining to
immediately destroy the found instance.

# Fancy JavaScript Helper

As shown, you have to go to a user's `show` page to delete them. What if we want
an admin control panel where users can be deleted from a list?

```erb
<!-- app/views/people/index.html.erb //-->

<% @people.each do |person| %>
<div class="person">
  <span><%= person.name %></span>
  <%= link_to "Delete", person, method: :delete, data: { confirm: "Really?" } %>
</div>
<% end %>
```

[`link_to`][link_to] is a method of `UrlHelper` that has a number of convenient features.

The HTML generated by that call to `link_to` looks like this:

```html
<a data-confirm="Really?" rel="nofollow" data-method="delete" href="/people/1">Delete</a>
```

The `data-confirm` attribute and the `data-method` attribute rely on some
JavaScript built into Rails.

`data-method` will "submit" a `DELETE` request as if a form had been submitted.
It will use `GET` (the default method used by all browsers for HTML links) if
the user has JavaScript disabled.

`data-confirm` pops up a confirmation window before the link is followed,
allowing the user to make sure they're ready to delete someone forever (what a
decision!).

## Use `button_to`

A slight variation from the `link_to` method described above is using `button_to` to send a delete request.

Says the [documentation][btdoc]:

> \[`button_to`\] Generates a form containing a single button that submits to the URL created by the set of options.

So while we taught `link_to` first, Rails thinks that `button_to` is a safer tool for representing delete requests. Interesting! The `button_to` helper works very similarly to `link_to`:

```ruby
<%= button_to "Delete Image", image_path(@image), method: :delete %>
```

As you can read in the documentation, or guess thanks to Ruby's simple syntax, the first argument is the button text; the second argument is an expression of a route, and `method` is used to tell the form to send its payload as an HTTP `DELETE` action.
