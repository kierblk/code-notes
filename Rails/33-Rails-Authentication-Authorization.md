## Breaking Down the Authentication and Authorization Problem

We can divide the "who can see what" problem into four smaller, but related
problems:

- Who you claim to be (i.e. **Identification**)
- Validation that you _are_ you who you claim to be (i.e. **Authentication**)
  and association of _roles_ based on your identity
- What given _roles_ are allowed to do (i.e. **Access Policy**)
- Mechanisms to enforce the Access Policy (i.e. **Authorization**)
